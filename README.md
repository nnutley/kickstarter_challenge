# **Kickstarting with Excel**


## *Overview of Project:*
    -Louise is an playwright who is interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund her play, Fever. In order to help Lousie, we have analyzed other crowdfunding data to determine what factors may impact the outcomes of these campaigns.

### Purpose:
    -The purpose of this analysis is to detemine if the outcomes of theater campaigns are impacted by the date that they were launched and to determine if the funding goal of a campaign impacts the outcomes of the campaigns.


## *Analysis and Challenges*: 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
    -In order to analyze if the theater outcomes were impacted by their launch date, I created a pivot table. The pivot table provided information on the number of campigns that were successful, failed, or were canceled within each month of the year. Additionally, this data could be broken down by a specific year if needed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
    -In order to analyze if the funding goal of a campaign impacted the outcome of the campaign, I created ranges for the goal of the campaigns and then determined the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns were within each of these specific ranges. I further refined this data by comparing the percentage of each outcome type within each specific range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    -Although I did not encounter any challenges with the analysis of this data, if it were impossible to break down this data based by the subcategory of Lousie's campaigns, it would lead to a much less in depth analysis and create difficultly in refining future campaigns to be successsful.


## *Results*

### Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date Conclusions:
    -Based upon the analysis of the theater outcomes based on launch dates, we can conclude that the largest difference between successul and failed campaigns occured between the months of May and July. This was primarly caused by a significant increase number of successful campaigns within these months.
    -We can also conclude that, in the month of December, there was no difference in the number of successful and failed campaigns, which was caused by the lowest number of successful campaigns when compared to the rest of the months. However, this was also the month with the lowest number of campaigns overall.
    
### Outcomes based on Goals Conclusions:
    -Based upon the analysis of the outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that there is a steady decrease in the percentage of successful campaigns up to the 25000 to 29999 goal range. Following that, there is an increase and then plateau between the 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999 goal ranges. Finally, this is another signficant decrease in the 45000 to 49999 goal range.

### Limitations of the dataset:
    -Although this dataset is broken down by a lot of different factors of these campaigns, we are still unable to know if these factors are true causes of the campaign outcomes or if they are merely just correlations. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have data about the different genres of the campaigns (comedy, drama, etc.) as these may show if perhaps some campaigns are not as successful because the genre of them is not as popular.

### Additional graph/tables to create:
    -If we used the launched date and deadline date to determine the length of the campaigns, we could create a graph/table to see if the length of the campaigns impacted their outcomes.
    -Another useful graph/table to create could be the number of backers versus the outcome to see if that had any impact on the outcome type.
